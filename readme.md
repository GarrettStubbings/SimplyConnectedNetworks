# Introduction
Code for the network optimization project (manuscript submitted).
Additionally, optimization data used in the manuscript are contained in PaperData.zip.

# Contents
Code for running stochastic simulations on a network model of health (stochastic simulation implementation written by Spencer Farrell (@SpencerFar), some additional measurements written by me).
Various standard graph generation algorythms also written by Spencer (preferential attachments, W-S Small world, etc.)

Custom graph generation and optimization algorithms written by me (now redundant C++ versions + the functional python versions).
Analysis of results of graph optimizations (health performance from network model + analysis of graphs) written by me.
